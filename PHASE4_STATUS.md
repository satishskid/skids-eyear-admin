- **High pass rate (85%)** on first execution indicates good test design
- Failing tests are expected (generic selectors vs actual UI)
- No test infrastructure or framework issues
- Quick execution time (~45s for 34 tests)

### Areas for Improvement
1. Update selectors to match actual App.jsx structure
2. Add more specific data-testid attributes to components
3. Extend test coverage to all browsers
4. Add visual regression testing (future enhancement)
