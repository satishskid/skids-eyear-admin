## 📊 Understanding Results

### Noise Monitor
- **Acceptable:** < 40 dB SPL (ANSI S3.1-1999 compliant)
- **Caution:** 40-50 dB SPL (may affect accuracy)
- **Too High:** > 50 dB SPL (test should pause)

### Audiogram Patterns
1. **Normal Hearing** - All frequencies detected
2. **High-Frequency Loss** - 4000-8000 Hz missed
3. **Low-Frequency Loss** - 500-1000 Hz missed
4. **Flat Loss** - Multiple frequencies missed
5. **Notch Pattern** - Specific frequency dip
6. **Severe Loss** - Most/all frequencies missed

### Referral Urgency
- **Low:** Minor concerns, routine follow-up
- **Medium:** Moderate loss, timely referral
- **High:** Significant loss, urgent referral

### Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)
- **100%** - Perfect speech understanding
- **75-99%** - Good speech understanding
- **50-74%** - Moderate difficulty
- **< 50%** - Significant speech comprehension issues
