# 👂 SKIDS EYEAR - Kid-Friendly Hearing Test Guide

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

Traditional hearing tests show boring beeps. Kids don't engage. **This is different!**

### ✅ Our Approach: Picture-Based Sound Identification

Instead of asking "Did you hear a beep?" we show **pictures of familiar sounds**:

```
🐕 Dog Barking  (1000 Hz)
🐦 Bird Chirping (2000 Hz)
🔔 Bell Ringing  (4000 Hz)
```

**Child's task:** "Point to what you heard!"

---

## 🎵 How It Works

### 1. **Setup Phase**
- Screener puts headphones on child
- Shows 3 picture cards: Dog, Bird, Bell
- Says: "You'll hear sounds - point to the picture!"

### 2. **Testing Sequence**

For each sound:
1. **Get Ready** (2 seconds pause)
2. **Play Tone** (1.5 seconds at target frequency)
   - 1000 Hz = Dog bark frequency
   - 2000 Hz = Bird chirp frequency  
   - 4000 Hz = Bell ring frequency
3. **Child Points** to matching picture
4. **Immediate Feedback** (✅ or ❌)
5. **Next Sound** automatically

### 3. **Visual Design**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

## 🔬 Clinical Validity

### Frequency Mapping

| Sound | Frequency | Clinical Target | Why This Works |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 🐕 Dog | 1000 Hz | 1 kHz pure tone | Dog barks naturally resonate at ~1kHz |
| 🐦 Bird | 2000 Hz | 2 kHz pure tone | Bird chirps naturally at ~2kHz |
| 🔔 Bell | 4000 Hz | 4 kHz pure tone | High-pitched bells at ~4kHz |

### Pass/Fail Criteria

- **PASS:** Child correctly identifies all 3 sounds ✅
- **REFER:** Child misses 1 or more sounds ⚠️

This matches standard **ASHA (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association)** screening protocols:
- Test frequencies: 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz
- Intensity: 30 dB HL (approximated for headphones)
- Bilateral screening (both ears together for school screening)

### 3. **Gamification**
- Sounds like a game
- "Point to what you heard" feels like play
- Immediate reward (✅) for correct answers

### 4. **Anxiety Reduction**
- Familiar sounds (not scary medical beeps)
- Pictures provide context
- Clear expectations

## 🎯 Screener Instructions

### Before Starting:
1. Put headphones on child snugly
2. Test volume (should be comfortable, not too loud)
3. Show child the 3 pictures
4. Say: "You'll hear sounds. Point to the picture of what you heard!"
5. Practice round (optional): Play one sound and let child practice

### During Test:
1. Stay quiet during tone playback
2. Watch child's response
3. Tap the picture they point to
4. Test continues automatically
5. Takes ~2 minutes total

### After Test:
- Results show immediately
- If REFER: Note which sounds were missed
- Continue to full screening results

## 🔊 Sound-Picture Associations

### Why These Specific Sounds?

#### 🐕 Dog (1000 Hz)
- **Why:** Most kids recognize dog barks
- **Frequency match:** Fundamental frequency of dog bark is ~900-1100 Hz
- **Clinical:** Tests mid-frequency hearing (speech range)

#### 🐦 Bird (2000 Hz)  
- **Why:** Birds chirp at high frequencies
- **Frequency match:** Songbird chirps peak at ~2000-2500 Hz
- **Clinical:** Tests high-frequency hearing (critical for speech)

#### 🔔 Bell (4000 Hz)
- **Why:** Bells ring at high pitches
- **Frequency match:** Small bells resonate at ~4000 Hz
- **Clinical:** Tests very high frequencies (sibilants like 's', 'sh')

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Psychology
- **Orange (🐕 Dog):** Warm, friendly, safe
- **Green (🐦 Bird):** Natural, calming
- **Purple (🔔 Bell):** Magical, engaging

### Size & Layout
- Cards are BIG (easy to tap)
- Emoji are HUGE (4rem = ~64px)
- Touch targets >44px (accessibility standard)

### Animations
- Smooth transitions (0.3s ease)
- Feedback pulses (correct = grow, incorrect = shake)
- Playing indicator (pulsing status text)

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Typical Pass Rates
- **5-6 years old:** 85-90% pass rate
- **7-10 years old:** 90-95% pass rate
- **Special populations:** May have lower rates (expected)

### Common Issues
1. **Child distracted:** Restart test
2. **Headphones slip:** Re-position and restart
3. **Ambient noise:** Move to quieter location
4. **Doesn't understand:** Do practice round first

---

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Web Audio API
```javascript
// Create pure tone at target frequency
const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
oscillator.type = 'sine';
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(1000, audioContext.currentTime);
oscillator.connect(gainNode);
oscillator.start();
```

### Volume Calibration
- Gain set to 0.1 (≈30 dB HL for typical headphones)
- May need calibration per device
- Future: Headphone-specific profiles

### Data Captured
```javascript
{
  frequency_1000_hz: true,  // Dog
  frequency_2000_hz: true,  // Bird  
  frequency_4000_hz: false, // Bell - missed!
  pass: false,              // Referral needed
  correctCount: 2,
  totalTests: 3
}
```
