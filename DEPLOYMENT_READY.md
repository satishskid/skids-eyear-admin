## 🔒 Security Considerations

### HTTPS Requirement
✅ **Required for:**
- Service Worker registration
- Camera/microphone access
- Secure data storage
- PWA installation

**Solution:** All recommended hosting options (Netlify, Vercel) provide automatic HTTPS.

### Data Privacy
✅ **Implemented:**
- All data stored locally (IndexedDB)
- No PHI in URLs or logs
- HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification
- Offline-first architecture

### Content Security Policy
Add to hosting platform headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; connect-src 'self' https://fhir.*.com;
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Recommended Tools

**1. Google Analytics 4 (Free)**
```javascript
// Add to index.html before </head>
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**2. Sentry (Error Tracking)**
```bash
npm install @sentry/react
```

**3. Netlify Analytics (Built-in)**
- Automatic on Netlify
- Shows page views, unique visitors
- No JavaScript required
